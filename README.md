DevSecOps Implementation in AWS with CI/CD, Security, and Monitoring

In the evolving world of software development, integrating security into the DevOps lifecycle, commonly known as DevSecOps, is crucial to ensuring that applications are both secure and scalable. This project focuses on implementing a DevSecOps pipeline in AWS, integrating Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), robust security practices, and comprehensive monitoring.

This DevSecOps project focuses on automating deployment and security practices using AWS, Jenkins, Docker, and tools like SonarQube, Trivy, Prometheus, and Grafana. The primary goal is to set up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline that integrates security (DevSecOps) and monitoring to ensure code quality, secure deployments, and system health tracking.
